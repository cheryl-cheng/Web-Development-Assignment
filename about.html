		What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about? 
		<ul>
			<li>I was able to make coloured buttons, checkboxes, radio boxes and hyperlinks that change colour when hovered over as a special feature.
			<li>Initially, I wanted to make it so that each search entry would be enclosed in a lilac coloured box,
			but I couldn't get a table or new div class to work in the while loop.
			<li>Another small feature is that the page is at 50% width on full screen, and shrinks proportionally with browser window size.
		</ul>
		Which parts did you have trouble with?
		<ul>
			<li>I had trouble with getting DateTime to work. I read up about namespaces and how it should already be included
			in PHP but I wasn't able to use it at all, and wasn't able to figure it out.
			<br>However, the solution I found does the same thing, just in a slightly more older fashion.
			<li>I also wasn't able to figure out bootstrap to try and make the statuses display in columns from the while loop.
		</ul>
		What would you like to do better next time?
		<ul>
			<li>I think the CSS looks quite nice, but next time I'd like to make it a look even nicer. I'm a beginner to CSS, 
			while general programming and databases are quite easy for me.
			<br>Because of workload from other papers I wasn't able to do even more with the CSS. 
		</ul>	
		What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?
		<ul>
			<li>Mainly I used Google and YouTube to figure out things that I couldn't get to work. 
			<li>Search results usually were from Stack Overflow or w3Schools.
			<li>PHP Sandbox was also extremely helpful to pick up missing brackets or semicolons.
		</ul>	
		What you have learnt along the way? 
		<ul>
			<li>I think this was quite a useful experience to learn HTTP and PHP programming in general. Most of the learning was
			making everything work with CSS.
			<li>This means using div classes, echo in PHP to use HTML classes, and learning how to change the layout and look. 
		</ul>
